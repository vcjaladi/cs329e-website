    <br><center><p class="lead">T in the Park festival is a major Scottish music festival that has been held annually since 1994. It is named after its main sponsor, the brewing company Tennents. The event was originally held at Strathclyde Park, Lanarkshire but was held at the disused Balado airfield, Kinross-shire from 1997 to 2014. In 2015 the festival moved to Strathallan Castle, Strathallan, Perthshire. Originally a two-day event, the festival became a three-day event in 2007. Promoted by DF Concerts, the event attracts up to 255,000 people, along with 70,000 campers.
