    <h3>About</h3>
	<br>
    <center><p>Rock in Rio is a recurring music festival originating in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It later branched into other locations such as Lisbon, Madrid and Las Vegas. Six incarnations of the festival were held in Rio de Janeiro, in 1985, 1991, 2001, 2011, 2013 and 2015, seven in Lisbon, in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016, three in Madrid in 2008, 2010 and 2012, and one in Las Vegas, in 2015. The seventh Brazilian edition will happen from September 15 to 24, 2017. Brazilian entrepreneur and advertiser Roberto Medina was responsible for the inception and organization of the festival, as well as moving the 2004 edition to Lisbon, while controversially keeping the brand "Rock in Rio".[1] In 2011, Rock in Rio returned to its original location, Rio de Janeiro, with a new line-up of singers and groups.
